# ontology_cx
The Data-Driven Ontology Toolkit (DDOT), that implements four recurring analytical procedures (Figure 4):

Expand Gene Set: Identify genes whose functions are highly similar to a seed set of genes.

Build Data-driven Hierarchy: Run the CLiXO algorithm to derive a hierarchy relating 

Hierarchical Alignment: Identify terms in a hierarchy that highly match terms in a reference hierarchy, such as the Gene Ontology.

Hierarchical Viewer: Interactively browse the structure of a hierarchy, including the data that supports the existence of each term in the hierarchy.

Note that the focus of DDOT is not on semantic tasks, which are typically the focus of other tools for analyzing biomedical ontologies. Instead, DDOT is focused on the hierarchical structures that reflect the physical reality of a cell, disease, or greater biological system. For creating, manipulating, and analyzing the hierarchical structure of an ontology for downstream tasks in machine learning.
